# The OID Initiative

* We look to develop the gold-standard for open datasets in investment research.
* Most alternative data companies make trials available to their institutional clients.
* It is out process that this process can happen out in the open without any loss to us and that everyone should be able to particiapte.
* As such we make our data available to anyone and everyone with a small lag, all paying users will get real-time datasets.
